Description: This package provides functions to conduct simulation and
    empirical analyses on multivariate time-series data. Correlation
    analyses are typically not robust when data are time series. Thus,
    this package was created to test the difference between analyses that
    take the time-series nature of the data into account versus those that
    do not.
